Scripts
*******

The scripts in this directory are meant as helpers for maintenance.

They normally require additional packages which can be easily
installed with `pip`.

They support storing autocomplete-friendly dicts of term lists. This
way we can offer autocomplete widgets that retrieve data from redis
DBs and that can contain millions of sets.


normalize.py
============

When fed with a packed list of keys/terms, generates another list with
the terms normalized followed by the key and the full term. Terms and
keys should be separated by ``&&``.

Requires `dinsort` package. If you are in an active `virtualenv` you
can install everything with::

  $ pip install dinsort

You need a file ``identifiers.txt.gz`` with all entries to
normalize. Results are written to ``terms.txt``.

The result file can be used as input for really feeding a redis DB
with fill-redis.py.


fill-redis.py
=============

Reads a list as generated by ``normalize.py`` and feeds the content to
a redis db.

Requires ``redis`` package. If you are in an active `virtualenv` you
can install everything with::

  $ pip install redis

Of course you will need a running redis DB to make all this work.
